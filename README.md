# qRT-PCR_webinar
companion analysis files for qRT-PCR webinar tutorial from 12, sept 2018 

In order to run the code as presented in the webinar I suggest users open the R markdown document "RTPCR_analysis_example.rmd" in the same directory as "gene.expressionR.csv" The entire analysis will run as is with no modification of code needed. 

You can review the companion excel spreadsheet to compare the analysis. 

You can also view the analysis tutorial in the associated html document or word document.
