# qRT-PCR_webinar
This directory exists for users interested in reviewing the full data analysis tutorial from a simulated qRT-PCR gene expression experiment analysis from a webinar I presented on 12 Sept, 2018. 

In order to run the code as presented in the webinar, I suggest users open the R markdown document "RTPCR_analysis_example.rmd" in the same directory as "gene.expressionR.csv" in the associated R Project file (if using R studio). The entire analysis will run as is with no modification of code (e.g. filepaths etc) needed. 


You can also view the analysis tutorial in the associated html document or word document. 

Also refer to the webinar slide deck saved as a PDF for reference.
